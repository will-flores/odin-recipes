# odin-recipes
introduction: build a basic recipe website that consist of a main page with links to a few recipes

skill demonstrated: git/github workflow, file/dir organization and labeling, basic commands, html commands/elements/attributes, multiple device workflow


reflection: Finished the project, just have to share the website on github. Overall took ~2 hours to complete, straight forward but tedious. Had to save a lot, double check for errors, and keep a lot of google tabs open. I got some muscle memory practice with elements, attributes, style, and indentation. I created a notes document to document my thoughts along the way. I usually do this whenever I edit videos so I thought it would be helpful here. Need to complete a teach-me explaining the project. See ya.
